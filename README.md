Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of credit risk data to understand the demographic profile of credit applicants and identify key risk factors contributing to credit defaults. Through detailed analysis, the project aims to provide actionable recommendations to enhance credit risk management practices.
Key Findings:
•	Demographics: The majority of credit applicants are middle-aged, highly educated females with high incomes. Most are married, do not have children, and work in the private sector.
•	Asset Ownership: Many applicants do not own a car but possess their own house or flat.
•	Default Rates:
o	Loan Type: Cash loans have a higher default rate compared to revolving loans.
o	Gender: Males have a higher default rate than females.
o	Income Type: Working-class individuals exhibit higher default rates compared to state servants and other categories.
o	Marital Status: Single or unmarried individuals have higher default rates compared to married individuals.
o	Occupation: Laborers, sales staff, and drivers show higher default rates.
o	Organization Type: Businesses and self-employed individuals have higher default rates.
o	Age: Adults (not middle-aged or elderly) exhibit higher default rates.
Recommendations:
•	Targeted Marketing: Focus on female applicants with tailored products and services.
•	Income Verification: Implement thorough income verification processes to ensure loan affordability.
•	Age-Specific Products: Develop financial products catering to the needs of middle-aged individuals.
•	Risk Mitigation for Repeat Clients: Implement stricter eligibility criteria and offer financial counseling for repeat clients with high default rates.
•	Gender-Specific Risk Analysis: Adjust risk assessment models to account for higher default rates among male applicants.
•	Marital Status Considerations: Factor in marital status in risk assessments and loan approval processes.
•	Loan Type Diversification: Diversify the loan portfolio to balance the risk between cash and revolving loans.
By analyzing these aspects, the project offers insights and strategies to better manage credit risk and enhance decision-making processes for credit approvals.
